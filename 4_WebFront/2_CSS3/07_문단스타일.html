                All we are are ghosts
                Shadows at the most
                Our fingertips, our holding on
                To something that we know is gone
                And though we are old friends
                And drive around the same old bends
                We've got our whole lives left
                So don't leave your words unsaid
                And down to our bones
                I think we both know
                I know we're counting the cost
                It's better to have lost
                Than never have loved at all
                Down to our bones
                Bones
                You say that you need space to breathe
                Well, maybe you need space from me
                You know just what I need
                You said you couldn't give it to me
                And down to our bones
                I think we both know
                I know we're counting the cost
                It's better to have lost
                Than never have loved at all
                And down to our bones
                I think we both know
                I know we're counting the cost
                It's better to have lost
                Than never have loved at…
